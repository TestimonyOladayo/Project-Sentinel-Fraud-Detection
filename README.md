# Project-Sentinel-Fraud-Detection
Graph-based Forensic Engine for detecting Multi-Agent Syndicates and Bonus Abuse in high-volume betting environments

Project Sentinel: Multi-Agent Fraud Architecture
Project Sentinel is a forensic AI framework designed for the iGaming and Sports Betting industry. While traditional models identify isolated anomalies, Sentinel uses Graph Theory to unmask interconnected "Syndicates" sharing hardware fingerprints.

Core Capabilities
Infrastructural Fingerprinting: Links users via IP_Address and Device_ID to expose bot farms.
Behavioral Velocity Analysis: Flags scripted betting patterns that deviate from human norms.
Bonus Abuse Detection: Isolates accounts with a 90%+ bonus utilization rate.

Technical Stack
NetworkX: For relational graph mapping and syndicate extraction.
Seaborn/Matplotlib: For forensic visualization of risk clusters.
Pandas/NumPy: For high-velocity feature engineering.
